Nice to meet you, my name is Diogo, and I am 20 years old. I have experience in C#, Visual Basic.NET, ASP.NET (along with JQuery), and SQL Server. I also have knowledge in Java (with Spring Boot), Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Next.js, ReactJs, and of course, in presentations and teamwork. Finally, I am fluent in English as well. I started learning in 2018 and graduated in 2019 at YÃ¡zigi.  
I also completed my Technical Education in Informatics at FIEC and am now pursuing a degree in Higher Education, as well as other professional courses to further enhance my knowledge.
