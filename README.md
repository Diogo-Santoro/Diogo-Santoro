Still studying, I am currently specializing in being a Full Stack developer, so I intend to learn a lot more about languages, such as Java, C#, and others, although I have already seen it, I want to go even further to be able to exercise my role wisely. Today intern at Isbet as .Net Developer, using Visual Basic .Net and ASP.Net
